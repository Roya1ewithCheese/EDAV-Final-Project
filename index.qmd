# Introduction

Understanding the characteristics of financial data is a first step for quantitative research. For this project, we chose to analyze stock daily return data from the S&P 500 index because it offers a diverse and widely studied dataset that is crucial for exploring key financial metrics. By examining raw stock return, we can compute essential statistics such as mean and variance (volatility), correlation between stocks, and the distribution of daily returns. This analysis forms the foundation for understanding how individual stocks behave and interact within the broader market.

Additionally, the project involves implementing simple factor models like the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and Fama-French models. Through linear regression, I will estimate factor loadings (betas) and excessive returns (alphas), evaluating their statistical properties such as mean, variance, and distribution. I will also test the performance of these linear models using t-statistics and p-values to understand how well the chosen factors explain stock returns linearly. While this project is exploratory and does not include advanced QR applications like portfolio optimization or alpha generation, it serves as a critical step in building the analytical and statistical tools required for such work.
