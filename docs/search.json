    "text": "1 Introduction\nUnderstanding the characteristics of financial data is a first step for quantitative research. For this project, we chose to analyze stock daily return data from the S&P 500 index because it offers a diverse and widely studied dataset that is crucial for exploring key financial metrics. By examining raw stock return, we can compute essential statistics such as mean and variance (volatility), correlation between stocks, and the distribution of daily returns. This analysis forms the foundation for understanding how individual stocks behave and interact within the broader market.\nAdditionally, the project involves implementing simple factor models like the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and Fama-French models. Through linear regression, I will estimate factor loadings (betas) and excessive returns (alphas), evaluating their statistical properties such as mean, variance, and distribution. I will also test the performance of these linear models using t-statistics and p-values to understand how well the chosen factors explain stock returns linearly. While this project is exploratory and does not include advanced QR applications like portfolio optimization or alpha generation, it serves as a critical step in building the analytical and statistical tools required for such work."

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe data for this project is sourced from Yahoo Finance, a widely used platform providing comprehensive historical market data for stocks and indices. The dataset includes daily records for multiple assets from the S&P 500 index, with columns such as Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume. The primary focus is on the Close price, which will be used to calculate the daily log returns. Log returns are derived by taking the natural logarithm of the ratio of successive closing prices. These returns are central to the analysis as they standardize price changes, making the data scale-independent and additive over time, which simplifies statistical modeling and comparisons. The log return is preferred over simple return because it accounts for compounding effects and ensures symmetry between positive and negative percentage changes, making it ideal for financial data analysis.\n\n\nCode\n# Display the first few rows of the resulting dataframe\nhead(sp500_stock_df)\n\n\n        Date     Open     High      Low    Close    Volume Adjusted Ticker\n1 2013-01-02 19.77929 19.82143 19.34393 19.60821 560518000 16.68734   AAPL\n2 2013-01-03 19.56714 19.63107 19.32143 19.36071 352965200 16.47671   AAPL\n3 2013-01-04 19.17750 19.23679 18.77964 18.82143 594333600 16.01776   AAPL\n4 2013-01-07 18.64286 18.90357 18.40000 18.71071 484156400 15.92354   AAPL\n5 2013-01-08 18.90036 18.99607 18.61607 18.76107 458707200 15.96639   AAPL\n6 2013-01-09 18.66071 18.75036 18.42821 18.46786 407604400 15.71686   AAPL\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Define the tickers of interest\nselected_tickers &lt;- c(\"AAPL\", \"TSLA\", \"NVDA\", \"JNJ\", \"JPM\", \"BRK-B\")\n\n# Filter the dataframe for the selected tickers\nsp500_subset &lt;- sp500_stock_df %&gt;%\n  filter(Ticker %in% selected_tickers)\n\n# Create the line plot\nggplot(sp500_subset, aes(x = Date, y = Adjusted, color = Ticker)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Adjusted Close Prices Over Time\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Adjusted Close\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough an initial glance at raw price data may provide a sense of how various assets evolve over time, such plots are not ideal for comparative analysis.

    "text": "2.2 The Limitations of Simple Plots for Analyzing Returns\nThe daily return plot looks like noise, oscillating about 0, and we cannot make anything out of it. The histogram of returns has a mean close to 0 and resembles a normal distribution. However, when we look at the compounding return over time, it clearly goes up and is no longer messy. Why is it so hard to capture information out of the return? It’s due to market efficiency: if the returns were obviously informative, then something would be wrong, because no one in the market is foolish. If the return data showed anything other than noise, it would mean easy profit opportunities, which would quickly vanish as participants exploit them through arbitrage. Unless you engage in high-frequency trading, it’s impossible to take advantage of such fleeting signals. Thus, it is perfectly normal for the returns to look like noise, as it reflects an efficient market."

In the long term, there are still profits to be gained, influenced by industry trends or other large-scale factors. While these factors are hidden within the daily noise, they become evident when returns accumulate. Simply using basic plots like this, however, won’t help us uncover these subtleties. There are many important patterns hidden in the return data, that are not easy to visualize.
