<h2 data-number="3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-fama-french-factor-model"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> The Fama-French Factor Model</h2>
<p>We apply the Fama-French three-factor model to the returns of the selected assets. The model is expressed as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
R_i - R_f = \alpha + \beta_1 (R_m - R_f) + \beta_2 \text{SMB} + \beta_3 \text{HML} + \epsilon
\]</span></p>
<p>Where: - <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span>: Return of the asset.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(R_f\)</span>: Risk-free rate.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(R_m\)</span>: Market return.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\text{SMB}\)</span>: Small-minus-Big factor, representing the size effect.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\text{HML}\)</span>: High-minus-Low factor, representing the value effect.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>: Intercept (alpha).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_3\)</span>: Factor loadings.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>: Residual error term.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of focusing solely on returns, our analysis emphasizes the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and the factor loadings <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3\)</span>.</p>
<p>The Fama-French three-factor model is a widely used framework in asset pricing that expands on the traditional CAPM by incorporating size and value factors to better explain stock returns. This model adds the Small-Minus-Big (SMB) factor, capturing the size effect, and the High-Minus-Low (HML) factor, representing the value effect, alongside the market risk premium. By including these additional dimensions, the Fama-French model accounts for systematic patterns in asset returns linked to company size and valuation. In this analysis, the focus lies on estimating the intercept (alpha) and factor loadings (<span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_3\)</span>) to understand the relationship between asset returns and these underlying factors.</p>
<p><strong>How we apply the Fama-French Model</strong></p>
<p>We get the factor loadings (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>s) by linear regression. However, return data is a time series. To fit a linear model on time series, we must always be cautious because the data might evolve through time. That means, “the more data, the better” does not apply to our linear model here. Instead we pick the data from a rolling window, say, the last 30 month, and fit the linear model. We then update the linear model every month. Eventually we get a series of linear model and factor loadings. We then can evaluate the factor loadings not only by its mean, but also the distribution and consistency. We can also study how the factor loadings change through time, or the correlation between factor loadings, or across different assets.</p>

<p>Alpha measures an investment’s excess return over a benchmark – the market or factor-based expectations. In models like Fama-French, it captures the portion of returns unexplained by factors such as market risk or size. In reality, alpha often reverts to zero as market inefficiencies are corrected, making it hard to find and sustain a constantly positive alpha. Investors aim for consistent, positive alpha as a source of stable excess return.</p>

<li><p>These stocks exhibit significantly higher mean alphas, indicating periods of consistent outperformance of the efficient market.

<p><span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> in the Fama-French model represents the factor loading for market risk, measuring how sensitive an asset is to overall market movements. A <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 &gt; 1\)</span> indicates that the asset is more volatile than the market, while <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 &lt; 1\)</span> suggests it is less sensitive to market changes. It evaluates the portion of an asset’s returns driven by systematic market risk, making it crucial for understanding exposure to broad economic trends. Investors rely on <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> to assess the asset’s alignment with market performance and its role in portfolio risk management.</p>
<p>Although it often appears to be so, a high <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> does not essentially mean a good sign. Because high volatility also brings more risk, causing significant loss when the market is going down. when the market is going upward, it is usually preferred to invest on assets with higher exposure to market risk.</p>

The plots of the factor loadings by stocks are shown below. We can notice that the coefficient of SMB and coefficient of HML seem to be negatively correlated.

<p>We can observe that there is a strong positive linear relationship between mean return and alpha. We can design new strategies based on this finding: apply Fama-French model to the return data, and select assets with good alpha. The advantages about this strategy is that it only uses idiosyncratic return as credential, not influenced by systematic risk, like the market risk premium, SMB or HML.</p>
<p><strong>What does “good” mean?</strong> It can mean a consistently positive alpha, like MSFT, or an alpha with high mean but very unstable, like TSLA or NVDA, depending on the investor’s strategy.</p>
<p>By faceting by asset, we can observe that different asset have a case.</p>

<p>These assets show strong linear relationship between alpha and mean return. When using Fama-French alpha as the trading strategy, these assets would be investors’ top choice.</p>

<p>For these assets, the residuals of the linear model change as fitted values change. Investors should take the value into consideration. For example, when the alpha of MA is low, investors should be cautious when using alpha as the indicator, because the linear relationship between alpha and return is weak when alpha is low.</p>

<p>For these assets, the alpha generated by the Fama-French model is not a good trading signal, because the linear relationship between alpha and return is very weak.</p>

<p>From the previous distribution plot, we can see that assets with high return (TSLA, NVDA, NFLX) not only have high <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, but also have high <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>, that is, they are also more exposed to the overall market performance. The following question is: can <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> be a good indicator for trading strategies?</p>
<p>In theory, a high <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> only means the asset is more sensitive to the market. And it would only perform well when the market is good, but performs worse when market is bad. (For example: if <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1=1.5\)</span>, when the market makes 2% return, the asset will make a 3% return, but when the market makes 2% loss, the asset will also make a 3% loss) However, the plots still show that top assets tend to have high <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>. We need further analysis to verify this observation.</p>

<p>From the scatter plot, we can see that <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> do not affect mean return significantly. This finding supports our theory, and points out falsehood of “<span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> means high return” that the ridgeline plot has shown.</p>

<p>Even faceted by asset, it is still hard to find linear relationship between <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> and mean return. However, we do have some new findings from the plot below, that can motivate a deeper study for a particular asset.</p>
<ul>
<li>V has a weak linear relationship</li>
<li>For assets like AAPL, GOOGL, PG, MSFT, there is an obvious non-linear relationship that can still be modeled.</li>
